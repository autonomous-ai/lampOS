# Texting the lamp from the Autonomous app (#1673)

A person can text the lamp from the Autonomous app and get an answer in
text, and the news of a task it handed over when nobody is at the lamp.
**Off unless `LAMP_MESSAGES=on`**, with `LAMP_CLOUD=on`.

The design was agreed on #1673 (the first builder, 19 October 07:3x and
08:05).

## The wire: V1's own

The app and the backend already speak V1's chat pair (`docs/mqtt.md` in the
repository above lampOS, "`chat.send` + `chat.event`"), so they need nothing
new for a text and its reply:

```
app ──HTTP──▶ backend ──fa: chat.send──▶ lamp-cloud ──chat/in──▶ the voice
app ◀── SSE ── backend ◀── fd: chat.event × N ── lamp-cloud ◀──chat/out── the voice
```

- **`chat.send`** (`{"message", "session_id", "speak"}`) is acked at once on
  `fd_channel` with `{"run_id", "session_id"}`, and the text goes on the bus
  as `chat/in` (`lamp_msgs::ChatIn`). `speak` is off unless asked: a text
  from another room never makes the lamp talk. A photo or a file is refused
  for now ("photos and files aren't read on this lamp yet"): a bus message
  is at most 60,000 bytes, so they will go through a file.
- **Nothing to answer:** with nothing on the lamp listening on `chat/in`, the
  text is refused at once ("nothing on this lamp answers texts right now"),
  not after a minute.
- **The answer** comes back on `chat/out` (`lamp_msgs::ChatOut`) in pieces,
  and goes out as `chat.event`s whose `event` is V1's `MonitorEvent`, which
  the app's chat already reads:
  - the reply's words so far as `assistant_delta`, gathered for 250 ms as
    V1's, with the words since the last in `summary`, an empty `id` and
    `detail.coalesced: true`;
  - the whole reply as `chat_response`, `state: "final"`, with a 200
    character `summary` and the text in `detail.message`, which ends the run;
  - a fault as `chat_response`, `state: "error"`, with `error`;
  - a task's news, sent while nobody is at the lamp, as `task_news`, with no
    run.
- **A run nothing answers** within 60 s ends as `chat_response`,
  `state: "error"`, "The lamp didn't answer in time. Please try again.", so
  the app never waits on a lamp that will not answer. Pieces for a run that
  has ended are dropped, as V1 mirrors only the runs it acked.

`lamp-cloud` looks for pieces every 50 ms between the broker's events
(`crate::chat`). Nothing in it waits on the voice.

## Who answers: the voice, in text (next)

A text conversation inside the voice, beside the spoken one, on the second
route's text client (`docs/second-voice.md`): the same character, notes,
memory and functions, never the room's Live session or its speaker. A skill
can't be the one that answers: a skill is a folder `lamp-skills` runs, with
no code of its own and no model (`docs/skills.md`), and a task's
confirmation lives in the voice. A task asked for in a text is confirmed by
a "yes" text from the same chat within 120 s, as the spoken path's. Gated on
the second route's config being there, and the journal says so when it
isn't.

## News when you're away (later)

When the tasks part has a task's news and nobody is at the lamp (no face and
no voice for 5 minutes, one presence signal shared with #1677), the news goes
to the app as `task_news` instead of into an empty room. That one event is
new on the wire: the backend relays a device-started event, and the app
shows it (#1673's app and backend half, after #1396).

## Tests

- `lamp_cloud::chat::tests`: a `chat.send`'s text, session and `speak`, and
  the refusals; words gathered for 250 ms, sent before the whole reply, which
  ends the run; a run unanswered for a minute; a fault and task news; the
  summary's length; each run's own name.
- `lamp_cloud::online::tests::a_text_is_acked_with_its_run_and_its_answer_goes_out_as_chat_events`:
  through the test broker, the ack on `fd_channel` with its run and session,
  then the answer's `chat.event`; without the switch, V1's refusal.
- `crates/cloud/tests/texts.rs`, through `Real` on a bus of the test's own: a
  text on `chat/in` and its answer from a stand-in voice back as V1's events;
  refused at once with nothing listening, and "not on this lamp" with the
  switch off; task news with no text asked first.
- `lamp_msgs::chat::tests`: the two types' checks and their wire.
